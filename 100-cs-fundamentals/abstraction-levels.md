* physical layer
  electricity, curent, voltage, condensator
  transistors
* instructions layer
  microprocessor instructions
  ISA, instruction set architecture
  machine instructions
  shared per cpu arch 1: CISC, RISC
  shared per cpu arch 2: x86, arm, powerpc
  shared per cpu model (in the same arch)
  shared per cpu generation (in the same arch): x86, x86_64
  shared per cput word: 8, 16, 32, 64 bits
  x86 (16-bit, 32-bit) -> x86_64 (32-bit, 64-bit) -> x64 (64-bit)
* logical layer
  bit
  bitstring
  opcode
  data and instructions
  word
  types
* language layers
  machine language
  assembly language (bijection to machine lang)
  higher-level langs
