# Denotational Semantics

## What
Denotational semantics is a method for formalizing the meaning of a PL (it gives mathematical meaning to PLs).

## How
This is done by constructing mathematical objects, called denotations, that describe the meaning of expressions in a PL.

Each expression in a PL is interpreted as a denotation - a conceptual meaning that can be thought of abstractly.

Denotations are often mathematical objects that inhabit a mathematical space.

In practice, denotations are described using some form of mathematical notation formalizable into a denotational metalanguage.

For instance, denotational semantics of functional languages often translates the language to domain theory. *Domain theory* is a branch of order theory as it studies *domains*, which are special kinds of posets.

Denotational semantic descriptions can also serve as compositional translations from a programming language into the denotational metalanguage and used as a basis for designing compilers.

Denotational semantics is a method that combines mathematical rigor with notational elegance. Originally, it was a tool for analysis, but grew to become a tool for language design and implementation.
