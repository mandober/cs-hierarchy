# Functionsfunctionanonymous functionclosure* A *closure* is a pair of a code pointer and an environment. It is an object "inside the machine" that exists at runtime.* A *lambda expression* is a syntactic entity, a piece of source code: something you can see on the screen.* A lambda expression evaluates to a closure, just as an integer literal (a string of digits) evaluates to an integer, or a 'new' expression evaluates to an instance (object).* A closure is a procedure that captures its free variables where those free variables are resolved in the lexical context.* A lambda procedure is just an anonymous procedure.* A lambda is not necessary a closure and a closure is not necessary a lambda.*Closures* are great syntactic elements, they create linguistic-friendly structures so easily and with so many benefits; automatic embedding of the lexical scope avoids unnecessary names, assignments and side effects; just consider how often do we write classes with a constructor, single method and a bit of state - something that closures encapsulate perfectly.
