# Data

Getting the data into a computer and storing it there has to deal with a lot of issues. The main problem is representation - how to represent the data in a computer so that it can be efficiently stored and manipulated by the machine, while at the same time addressing human concerns (in terms of reasoning about the data representation and making interpretation and interaction with the data sufficiently comfortable).

In the end, all that data is in a computer is but a stream of bits, whether stored for prolonged persistance, or flowing through the memory hierarchy of a computer system (main memory, various levels of caches and registers in a CPU).
