## DB
Database (DB or db) is a collection of structured data.

## RDB
Relational database is a db with multiple tables containing related data.

## SQL
Standard Query Language (SQL)

## T-SQL
Transaction-SQL

## RDBMS
Relational Database Management System.
RDBMS is a DBMS, but a DBMS is notnecessarily a RDBMS.

## DBMS
A database management system (DBMS) is an application that enables the creation and administration of databases.

Although RDBMS has been the most popular database model since the 1980s, there are many other DBMS types, including: OODBMS, ORDBMS, flat file, hierarchical, network, NoSQL.

## OODBMS
Object-orientated database management system

## ORDBMS
Object-Relational Database Management System.

## TPS
Transactions per second

## OLTP
Online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads consist of a number of short transactions running concurrently. OLTP databases must be capable of fast query processing and maintaining data integrity under concurrency. For OLTP systems, effectiveness is measured by the number of transactions per second (TPS). Factors like CPU utilization, disk latency, network latency, and memory pressure impact the overall performance.

## NoSQL
Column store, document store, graph, key-value database containing mainly unstructured data.

## ACID
In database systems, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) refers to a standard set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably.
ACID is especially concerned with how a database recovers from any failure that might occur while processing a transaction.
An ACID-compliant DBMS ensures that the data in the database remains accurate and consistent despite any such failures.

## Database Schema
A schema is the organisation and structure of a database. A schema contains schema objects, which could be tables, columns, data types, views, stored procedures, relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, etc.
