A number representation specifies a way of encoding a number as a sequence of binary digits.



## Numeral system

**Number** is an abstract primitive mathematical object that can be represented using different systems.

**Number systems** are sets of number classes, such as the natural numbers and the real numbers.

**Numeral** is the notational symbol that represents a number. It is important to differentiate between the properties of a number and properties of its numeral. For example, "being even" is a property of a number (regardless of the number system) and "sum of its digits" is a property of denotation (and it depends on the number system).

**Numeral system** (system of numeration) is a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set, using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. The same sequence of symbols may represent different numbers in different numeral systems.



Each of subsequent digit is associated with a *place value*, also called *weighting factor*.
