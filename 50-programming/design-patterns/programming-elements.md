# Programming Elements

Computer scientists use algorithmic process to create, describe and transform information and formulate suitable abstractions to design and model complex systems.

Controlling complexity
- by building abstractions that hide details when appropriate.
- by establishing conventional interfaces that enable us to construct systems by combining standard, well-understood, pieces.
- by establishing languages that efficiently describe a design

Mathematics deals with notions of *what is*, while CS deals with *how to*.
