**Arity** or **adicity** (also adinity) is:
- the number of parameters a function declares
- the number of arguments in a function call
- the number of operands an operation takes
- the number of components in a tuple
- the number of domains in the Cartesian product (for relations)
- the maximum number of child nodes that any node in a given tree may have

Most often in CS, arity refers to the number of function parameters.

English has two series of arities, functioning as *distributive numbers*: arity comes from Latin and adicity is from Ancient Greek. The Latinate series is frequently confused with ordinal numbers, as both end in the suffix "-ary".

Distributive number is a word that answers the question "how many times each?" or "how many at a time?", e.g. singly, doubly, and triply.

This is most significant for quaternary (arity, used for both) vs. quartary (ordinal) and novenary (arity) vs. nonary (ordinal, used for both). However, this is more commonly expressed in the form of phrases such as "one by one", "two by two", then "one at a time", "two at a time", then "one of each", "two of each", then "in twos", "in threes", or using a word for counting, e.g. "in groups of two" or "two pieces to a data".

The Latinate series is used for names of the positional numeral systems with small bases (e.g. binary, ternary), but then the names have other forms from the base-8 onwards (so, it is, e.g., "octal" and not "octonary").
