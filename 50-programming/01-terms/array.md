# ArrayIn the original and the strictest sense, an array is a sequence of values in contiguous memory locations. The contiguous layout exhibits the *locality of reference*, especially the *sequential locality* which is a property of a data (structure) whose elements are arranged and accessed linearly. Array hits all these desirable points that fully exploit CPU's caching behaviour and patterns of data access, thus remaining the most performant data structure.An array is laid out on the stack which makes for fast access but constrains its size and type: arrays are homogenuous and have fixed size. Actually, a type of an array varies across two dimensions as it is determined by the type of containing elements and by their number.For example, saying that we have "an array" states an incomplete type, and so does saying that we have "an array of integers" (it's jsut slightly less general); the fully specified, concrete, type is stated by saying "an array of 5 integers". A type that is (at least partly) determined by its contents is called a *dependent type*.```rust// explicit type annotationlet a: [u32; 4]  = [1,2,3,4];// partial type annotations:let a: [_; 4]  = [1,2,3,4];let a = [1i64,2,3,4];// inferred type: [i32; 4] let a = [1,2,3,4];``````c// with initializerint[] arr = {1,2,3,4};// declaration onlyint[4] arr;// type declaration and initializerint[4] arr = {1,2,3,4};// all elements init to zero:int[4] arr = {0};```
