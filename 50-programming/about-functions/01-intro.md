# Callables

The generic umbrella term "callable" is used here due to the lack of a more suitable term that better describes the phenomenon found in programming languages that the following, more-less synonyms, also refer to: callable block/unit, subroutine, routine, procedure, subprogram, function, method, macro.

No matter the term, they all sufficiently denote the essential quality of a *callable*: taking a sequence of frequently performed programming instructions and putting them in a separate language block, which then stands a separete language unit that embeds a particular functionality and provides a convenient access to it whenever needed.

A callable gives us the most fundamental means of abstraction in programming.

a tool that we use the most fundamental way to achieve abstraction

as we can reference the unit can be referred to whenever that particular task need be performed.


Whenever we recognize a useful behaviour or even a repetitive pattern, we can extract the code that describes it and make it a separate unit for easy access.

A callable gives us the way to construct a higher-level programming blocks that go beyond what a particular PL provides.


All programming languages have some kind of callable.
