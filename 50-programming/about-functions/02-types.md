# Kinds of callables

A callable is made out of programming instructions that are extracted into a separate block that is then (re)usable as a single language unit, performing the embedded functionality whenever invoked.

There are many more or less related terms to this phenomenon, but some terms are more (strictly) defined then others. Even though every language is free to introduce confusion and ambiguity by dictating its own definitions, some better established terms are more resilient to alteration. This must be the destiny of the other terms as well, just so we can preserve the basic assumption that the terms we use (still/always) have the intended, one and the same, precise meaning, regardless of the (programming language) context and (developers) cortex (the so called context/cortex-free terms).


**Function**   
A function always returns a value


There is hardly a difference between the two, except that a function returns a value, where a subroutine just repeats lines of code (A function is not always used more than once).
