# Programming Language

Motivation, Rationale, High-level notion identification:
* activity    : Programming
* tool        : Programming Language
* end product : Program


PL:
- Theory
- Structure
- Family, Category, Order, Level (not: class, type)
- Paradigm
- (entities, org groups):
  - functional, structural, informative, 
  - prescriptive, descriptive
- Elements Items Features
- Constructs
- Concepts, Notions
- Phases
- Citizen classes: first-class value


* PL components *elements? meta-elements?*
  - syntax
  - semantics
  - grammar


* PL items
  - org: fn, class, mod
  - abstracts, DRY

* PL Constructs
  - values: literals, constants, scalar, compound, objects, refs
  - variables: bound, free, params, args,
  - procedure: subroutine, function, closure, lambda, anonymous, callable
  - class
  - object

Expressions Functions Heap storage Exceptions Modules Objects Threads

* PL Concepts
  - datatype
  - binding
  - scope
  - state
  - IO

* PL Phases (time)
  - authoring-time, design-time,
  - compile-time
  - run-time
  - debugging-time
  - testing-time


* by forks in the road
  - type system
  - safety
  - provable
  - threads (sys vs green)


* by dev methodology (not here, put in software)
  - extreme
  - waterfall


## PL Classification

* by evaluation strategy
  - normal, applicative
  - lazy, call-by-need
* by type system
  - static, dynamic
  - weak, strong
* by paradigms
  - imperative
  - declarative
  - functional
* by abstraction
  - machine code
  - object code
  - byte code
  - intermediate lang
  - assembly
* by implementation
  - interpreted, JIT
  - compiled
  - mixed
* by generation
  - first gen
  - second gen
  - third gen
  - fourth gen
  - fifth gen
* by level
  - low-level
  - mid-level
  - high-level
* by style
  - C style, *"braces n' semi-colons"*
    - B, C, C++, C#, D, Nim, Java
  - Python style, *layout and whitespace*
    - py, Haskell
* by purpose
  - system programming
    - C, C++, Rust
  - embedded
    - bash, blackbox
  - teaching
    - Lego ?, Racket
  - Shell
    - bash, powershell
  - DSL
    - docker, ansiable
  - scripting
    - ruby, py, js
  - Math
    - Matematica, WA, MathML
  - Publishing
    - GhostScript
    - MathML
    - latex, tex, katex
  - markup
      - HTML, XHTML
      - Markdown, ASCII
      - MathML
  - configuration
    - XML
    - JSON, jsonc
    - TOML
    - ini
    - yaml

* by expressiveness
* by popularity
* by age
* by feature *for popularizing a thing*
