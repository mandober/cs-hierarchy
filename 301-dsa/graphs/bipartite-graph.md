# Bipartite graph

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph

In graph theory, a **bipartite graph** or **bigraph** is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.

Vertex sets U and V are usually called the parts of the graph. Equivalently, a bipartite graph is a graph that does not contain any odd-length cycles.
