# Graph terminology

## Graph
In graph theory, a graph is a structure consisting of a related set of objects, called vertices and represented by circles, and a relation involving a pair of objects is represented by a connecting line between them, and called an edge. The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (nodes) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (link).

## Acyclic
A graph is acyclic if it has no cycles. An undirected acyclic graph is the same thing as a forest.

## DAG
Directed acyclic graph.

## Forest
A forest is an undirected graph without cycles (a disjoint union of unrooted trees), or a directed graph formed as a disjoint union of rooted trees.

## Walk
A walk (chain) is a (finite or infinite) sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices. A *open walk* is a walk whose first and last vertices are distinct; in a *closed walk*, they are the same vertex.

## Cycle
A cycle is a non-empty path from a node to itself.

## Path
A path is a sequence of adjacent vertices and edges, from some starting node to an endpoint node.
