# Graph theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory

In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in such context is made up of vertices (nodes, points) which are connected by edges (links, lines).

*Edges* are **unordered pairs** of vertices; that is, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices. A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link asymmetrically.

A graph is an ordered pair `G=(V,E)` comprising:
- a set of vertices, `V`
- a set of edges, `E`
