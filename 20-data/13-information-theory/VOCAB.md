# Information Theory: Glossary

## Information
Sequence of symbols that can be interpreted as a message. Information can be recorded as signs, or transmitted as signals.

## Data
Values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items. Data in computing (or data processing) are often represented by a combination of items organized in rows and multiple variables organized in columns. Data are typically the results of measurements and can be visualised using graphs or images.

## Computer data
Information in a form suitable for use with a computer. Data is often distinguished from programs. A program is a sequence of instructions that detail a task for the computer to perform. In this sense, data is everything in software that is not program code.
