# Data type


Computer science is concerned with classification of data it deals with into appropriate categories called the data types. However, unlike its "parent" science math, which is generally free to organize the data however it sees fit, computer science is constrained by the physical limits of a computer.

The data types in CS are a compromise between what we want to represent and what is representable at all, on a finite device that is computer.

We must always keep in mind that computers basically only deal with what they can represent reliably and that is the two states, commonly interpreted as either true/false or one/zero. Fortunately, the two distinct states is all that's needed to cleanly map the traditional Boolean logic with its True and False values, which introduces logic in computations i.e. ability to make decisions based on values, thus allowing a computer to evolve beyond a mere calculator.




binary numbers arising from the two states 
two states, commonly considered numbers 0 and 1.
numbers, and only two of them
represent two distinct states, usually considered as numbers 0 and 1.
The first (mathematical) concept to fall victim of this limitation is the concept of infinity (or infinities) and the attempt to cleanly map e.g. number types from math to CS falls short. 
of numbers from math to CS
immediate consequence of this is that the concept of infinity (infinities goes out the windows)
and the actual computer data types
that came to be as an intermix between 


A (data) type is a property of data
which tells the compiler/interpreter
how the programmer intends to use the data.

Most programming languages support common data types of real, integer and boolean.

A data type constrains the values that an expression, such as a variable or a function, might take.

This data type defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored.

A type of value from which an expression may take its value.




A data type defines a range of values which the variable is capable of storing, and it also defines a set of operations that are permissible to be performed on variables of that type.
