# Concrete data types in programming languages

## Pascal
A type in Pascal defines a variable in such a way that it defines a range of values which the variable is capable of storing, and it also defines a set of operations that are permissible to be performed on variables of that type.

The predefined types are:

Data type	Type of values which the variable is capable of storing
integer	integer (whole) numbers
real	floating-point numbers
boolean	the values True or False
char	a single character from an ordered character set
string	a sequence or "string" of characters
set	equivalent to an array of boolean values
