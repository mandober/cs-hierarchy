# Types and Programming Languages

## 1.4 History

The earliest type systems in CS were used to make very simple distinctions between integer and floating point representations of numbers (Fortran). In the late 1950s, this classification was extended to structured data (arrays of records) and higher-order functions. In the 1970s, a number of richer concepts like parametric polymorphism, abstract data types, module systems, subtyping were introduced, and type systems emerged as a field in its own right. At the same time, computer scientists began to be aware of the connections between the type systems found in PLs and those of mathematical logic (CHI), leading to a rich interplay that continues to the present.
