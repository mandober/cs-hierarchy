# Ad Hoc Polymorphism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism

Parametric polymorphism may be contrasted with **ad hoc polymorphism**, in which a single polymorphic function can have a number of distinct, potentially heterogeneous, implementations, depending on the type of arguments to which it is applied. Thus, ad hoc polymorphism can generally only support a limited number of such distinct types, since a separate implementation has to be provided for each type.
