Raw computer **data** is a bunch of bits, without inherent structure, open to arbitrary interpretation. There is no indication what such raw data stands for; it is even impossible to discern whether it constitutes an instruction or a user data; at least in the dominant, von Neumann computer architecture,instruction data is not separate from the user data. These sentences illustrate how hard it is to distinguish between different kinds of data. Everything is data, instructions are data as is the user (payload) data. It's data operating on data. This shows that it is practically impossible to make sense of unstructured data.

In order to be useful, data has to be structured, it has to have some kind of structure that directs access to data. However, formation of structures isn't possible at this low level of abstraction where raw data is. To find structure we have to go several level up to the value level



In an unconstrained access to data, a bit pattern known to represent a character (like a letter "a") may be interpreted as if it were an integer.

Data may exist stored in a memory, as as tream of bits transferred through the wires or being processed by the CPU in which case it may go through several representation conversions, as it travels through the computer infrastructure, from memory, through bus lanes, cache, registers, into processing units, and back into storage.


**Data typing** is classification of data into data types, which define the ways the data is intended to be used. A type defines the meaning of the data and the operations that can be taken on such data. It may also define the way the data of that type should be stored.

A **data type** is a constraint placed upon the interpretation of data in a type system, describing representation, interpretation and structure of values stored in memory.
