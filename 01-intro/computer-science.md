# Computer science

**Computer Science** (CS) studies
* theoretical foundations of information - Information Theory (IT)
* theoretical foundations of computation - Theory of Computation (ToC)

CS seeks practical techniques for implementation and application of IT and ToC in computer systems.

CS uses algorithmic process to create, describe and transform information and formulate suitable abstractions to design and model complex systems.

Besides theoretical, computer science also explores practical engineering aspects related to the design of computational systems and issues of hardware and software integration.

> CS is the scientific and engineering approach to computation, systemizing the feasibility, structure, implementation and mechanisms of algorithms that underline acquisition, representation, processing, storage, transmission and access of data.

*Computer science* is the study of problems, problem-solving, and the solutions that come out of the problem-solving process. Given a problem, a computer scientist’s goal is to develop an algorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise. Algorithms are finite processes that if followed will solve the problem. Algorithms are solutions.

*Programming* is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer. Although many programming languages and many different types of computers exist, the important first step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.

All data items in the computer are represented as strings of binary digits. In order to give these strings meaning, we need to have data types. Data types provide an interpretation for this binary data so that we can think about the data in terms that make sense with respect to the problem being solved. These low-level, built-in data types (sometimes called the primitive data types) provide the building blocks for algorithm development.

**Abstract data type** (ADT) is 
a logical description of 
how we view the data and 
the operations that are allowed 
without regard to 
how they will be implemented;    
we are primarily interested in 
*what the data is representing*, 
not in the *implementation details*.

By providing this level of abstraction, we are creating an encapsulation around the data. The idea is that by encapsulating the details of the implementation, we are hiding them from the user’s view. This is called information hiding.

The implementation of   
an abstract data type,   
often referred to as    
a data structure,   
requires that     
we provide    
a physical view of the data    
using some set of   
programming constructs and   
primitive data types.

The separation of these two perspectives will allow us to define the complex data models for our problems without giving any indication as to the details of how the model will actually be built.

This provides an implementation-independent view of the data.

Since there will usually be many different ways to implement an abstract data type, this implementation independence allows the programmer to switch the details of the implementation without changing the way the user of the data interacts with it. The user can remain focused on the problem-solving process.


## TCS
Theoretical computer science (TCS) is a subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more mathematical topics of computing and includes the theory of computation. TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, computational number theory and algebra, coding theory, computational learning theory, and theoretical computer science aspects of areas such as databases, information retrieval, economic models, and networks.
