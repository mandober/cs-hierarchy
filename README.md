*"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of hierarchy that reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, confusion, restlessness, sexual frustration and social alienation which is being felt by a generation of disenfranchised computerists amidst the declining economic situation and bland demo scene at the end of 2010s."* -- Simon Ferocious
